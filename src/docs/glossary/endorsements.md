In the Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol, for every level, a list of
Accounts is randomly chosen to create and sign the corresponding
block. As a consequence, multiple blocks can be submitted at the same
level. To choose between such blocks, another list of Accounts is
randomly chosen to vote for one of these blocks: each Account can
Endorse one and only one of these blocks. Endorsements increase the
Fitness of the Blocks, so that the Block with the highest number of
Endorsements is more likely to be chosen.

Endorsements for a given Block are submitted as operations stored in
the next Blocks after that Block.
