At any given time, multiple nodes are competing to create the next
official block. All these blocks are branches of the official
Blockchain, on which other blocks are added by other nodes. Each node
chooses the branch with the highest Fitness as the official one, but
still watches the Fitness of other branches, until they are completely
discarded. Such competing branches are called Alternative Heads.
