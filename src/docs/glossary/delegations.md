As part of the Proof-of-Stake Consensus Algorithm, Accounts are
expected to bake/mine Blocks, endorse Blocks baked by other Accounts
and vote for Protocol Amendments. Performing all these operations
requires Account owners to run special nodes on their computers, or,
if they don't want, to Delegate their voting rights to other Accounts,
their Delegates. Such Delegates are expected to share some of the
benefits associated with these operations to the delegated Accounts.
