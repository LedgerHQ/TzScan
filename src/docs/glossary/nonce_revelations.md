As part of the Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol, each Baker of a
Block in a Cycle is expected to reveal a Nonce (some Random Number)
during the next cycle, to create together a Seed that will be used in
the next Cycle to compute deterministically the lists of Bakers and
Endorsers for all the Blocks to be baked in that Cycle.
