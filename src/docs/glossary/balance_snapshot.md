Balance is divided into 6 categories:

#### Evaluated balance
This is the total balance of the account, including the spendable and frozen balances.

#### Balance, or spendable balance
This is the current balance you can use for transactions, deposits, etc.

#### Frozen, or frozen balance
This balance is the sum of the rewards, the fees and the deposits. This balance is not spendable,
i.e. it is not real currency yet. You have to wait 5 cycle to unlock it, unless you double bake or
double endorse a block in which case, you lose all frozen balance of the current cycle.

#### Rewards
Each time you bake or endorse a block, you earn rewards based on the current cycle.

#### Fees
Some transactions are conditionned by fees, usually a very small amount.

#### Deposits
Each time you bake or endorse a block, you freeze some of your spendable balance up to some
amount depending on the current cycle.

## How to read this tab

### Snapshot
Differences (the value besides the arrows) are calculated from the begin of the cycle.
Estimations are calculated by checking your baking rights under the hypothesis you never miss any
bake. In the case of fees, the estimation is provided by calculating the mean of the previous
fees differences of the 5 previous cycles.
