  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>TzScan is a block-explorer for Tezos, built
  by <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/">OCamlPro</a>. It was initially
  released in Feb 2018, running on the Alphanet at that time. Its goal
  was not only to be useful to Tezos users, but also to the
  development team, so we often switched the network to follow the
  most recent developments. On June 30, 2018, it was up for the Launch
  of the Betanet network.</p>

  <h3>OCamlPro and Tezos</h3>

  <p>OCamlPro has been involved in the development of Tezos since
  2014, when Arthur Breitman contacted us to design the prototype of
  Tezos, and develop it until 2017. We then developed the ICO platform
  of Tezos (on Ethereum and Bitcoin), that allowed the Tezos
  Foundation to raise 235 M$. After the ICO, OCamlPro switched to other Tezos projects, such as TzScan, the
  block-explorer for Tezos, and Liquidity, a smart-contract language
  over Michelson.  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.liquidity-lang.org/">Liquidity</a>:
      OCamlPro has developed a high-level language for Tezos smart
      contracts, with OCaml syntax.  It comes with a compiler to
      Michelson, and a decompiler (to be able to easily audit
      Michelson contracts).
